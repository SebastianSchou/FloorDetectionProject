This project is made as part of the requirement to obtain a master degree in Electrical Engineering with a specialization in Robotics and Automation at the Technical University of Denmark for the student Sebastian Schifter Schou, 2021.

The project utilizes a Intel Realsense D435 to register traversable areas and uses that information in path planning.
